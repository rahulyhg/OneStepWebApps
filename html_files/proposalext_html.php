<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">The areas we are proposing to paint (scope of work):</h2>
<p>*Unless otherwise clearly defined above, all work shall be preformed at the Level 3 Surface Preparation and Finish Appearance standard (see below)</p>
<p class="underline">Excluded:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All exterior concrete floor surfaces</li>
  <li>All chimney, roof and roof mounted items</li>
  <li>All other perimeter fencing and other landscape items</li>
  <li>All other surfaces not specifically mentioned above</li>
</ul>
<p class="underline">Included in our standard procedures:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pressure wash all surfaces scheduled for painting work as needed</li>
  <li>Trench down 4” below grade wherever stucco meets ground</li>
  <li>Remove exterior lighting prior to painting and reinstall when completed</li>
  <li>All grounds and plants will be covered prior to any painting</li>
  <li>Left over paint will be labeled and left for future touch-ups.</li>
  <li>At the completion, our trained project manager will carefully inspect all surfaces to insure our quality standard has been met.</li>
</ol>
<p class="underline">Levels of Surface Preparation & Finish Appearance</p>
<ul>
  <li>The following levels are used to establish a clearly-communicated standard as to what has been agreed upon and what is to be expected with regards to the different levels of surface preparation and the quality of appearance of the finished surface.  They are a summary of the actual standard based on PDCA (Painting & Decorating Contractors of America) Industry Standard P14-06.</li>
  <li> <strong>Level 1</strong> – Basic: <span class="underline"><i>Cleaned, No Patching </i></span> - Requires only basic cleanliness of surfaces to ensure the adhesion of new finishes, with less concern for the adhesion of existing paint and quality of appearance.  Obvious loose paint will be removed, but no smoothing of the existing surface profile will be done.  Includes light power washing, or hand cleaning. <span class="underline">No Warranty</span></li>
  <li><strong>Level 2</strong> – Standard:<span class="underline"> <i>Basic Patching</i></span> - Requires all of Level 1 as well as the examination of existing coatings to assess their adhesion. With this level of surface preparation, good adhesion and longevity of finish are of primary concern and appearance is of secondary concern. Includes basic patching, filling, caulking, dulling of glossy surfaces, spot priming, and light sanding/abrading to address surface profile differences exceeding 1/8 inch.  Excludes matching stucco textures.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 3 – Superior:<span class="underline"> <i> Detailed Patching</i></span> – Requires all of Levels 1 and 2 with added emphasis on the quality of appearance of finish painted surfaces. Includes detailed patching, filling, approximate matching of stucco textures, and thorough sanding to address surface profile differences exceeding 1/16 inch.  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Level 4</strong> – Supreme: <span class="underline"><i>Touch & Feel</i></span> – Requires all of Levels 1, 2 and 3 with even more emphasis on the quality of appearance of finish painted surfaces. The criteria for inspection and acceptance may include smoothness to “touch and feel” on doors, windows and easily accessible trim.  Includes thorough filling & sanding to address surface profile differences exceeding 1/32 inch.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 5</strong> – Restoration/Resurfacing: <span class="underline"> <i>Back to Original</i></span> – This type of surface preparation is required when existing conditions indicate that the surfaces are <span class="underline">severely deteriorated</span>(where damage to the coating is widespread).  Includes complete or nearly complete removal of existing paint through various stripping methods.  Substrate (underlying surface being painted) may need to be completely replaced, repaired or resurfaced.</li>
</ul>
<p class="underline">Cost</p>
<ul>
	<li>We propose to furnish material and labor – complete and in accordance with the above specifications for the sum stated below.  Individual tasks, if selected, may require additional pricing.  Price is valid for 30 days, unless otherwise noted.</li>
