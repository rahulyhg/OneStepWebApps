<p>Below are the samples on how to control your paragraph pagination. See &quot;Line and Page Break&quot; tab on paragraph properties window to see the attribute set by these controls.</p>
<p>Paragraph with widowControl = false (default: true). A &quot;widow&quot; is the last line of a paragraph printed by itself at the top of a page. An &quot;orphan&quot; is the first line of a paragraph printed by itself at the bottom of a page. Set this option to &quot;false&quot; if you want to disable this automatic control.</p>
<p>Paragraph with keepNext = true (default: false). &quot;Keep with next&quot; is used to prevent Word from inserting automatic page breaks between paragraphs. Set this option to &quot;true&quot; if you do not want your paragraph to be separated with the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Paragraph with keepLines = true (default: false). &quot;Keep lines together&quot; will prevent Word from inserting an automatic page break within a paragraph. Set this option to &quot;true&quot; if you do not want all lines of your paragraph to be in the same page.</p>
<p>Keep scrolling. More below.</p>
<p>Paragraph with pageBreakBefore = true (default: false). Different with all other control above, &quot;page break before&quot; separates your paragraph into the next page. This option is most useful for heading styles.</p>
